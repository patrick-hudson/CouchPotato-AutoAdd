# CouchPotato-AutoAdd
Autoadd movies to couchpotato using omdbapi and CouchPotato API

```
Fill movielist.txt with a list of movie titles. One per line.
Run imdbget.php to retreive the IMDB ID for each movie
```

Modify couchpotatoadd.php


```
Change $couchpotatourl to the URL of your couchpotato server. Do not add a trailing slash

Change $apikey to your API Key found in Settings -> General (Must enable advanced options)

Run couchpotatoadd.php (I recommend doing it from the same server as couchpotato other wise it's rather slow

```
Wait for all your movies to be added

Option step:
Buy more hard drive space because you just added 25000 movies to your CouchPotato instance.
